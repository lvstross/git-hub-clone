# Git Hub Clone Project

This node server is an express application that will mimic the basic functionality of github by doing the following things

1. Create remote repositories
2. View the code in your repositories
3. Clone remote repositories
4. Push changes and branches to the remote repositories
5. Mark repositories as public or private

Wish me luck ;)
